Background: 

            Our company is a car dealership that sells various car models. To effectively track and analyse 
	    our sales performance, we need a comprehensive Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI. 
Objective: 

            The objective of this project is to design and develop a dynamic and interactive Car Sales 
	    Dashboard using Power BI.  The dashboard will visualize critical KPIs related to our car
            sales, helping us understand our sales performance over  time and make data-driven decisions.
Problem Statement 1: KPI’s Requirement
            
            The dashboard should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) related
	    to our sales data. This will enable us to make informed decisions, monitor our progress, and 
            identify trends and opportunities for growth.
